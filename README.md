heroku
======

heroku files for various projects and scripts to assemble

Warning:
Not all projects are committed to github.
What to do about it?
Make heroku project dir on github for extra files and shell scripts to sync/copy files from repos?
Git submodules?
Perhaps subtree merge strategy is more appropriate?

 - has extra heroku files in this repo
 - TODO: fix. submodule?
